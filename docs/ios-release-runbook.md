# iOS CLI/API release runbook

This runbook keeps the iOS release path reproducible without using the Xcode
GUI. It distinguishes the protected GitHub-hosted path from a self-hosted or
SSH Mac because their keychain requirements are different.

## Shared prerequisites

- Apple Developer membership and an App Store Connect app record for
  `top.vansin.agentnetwork` under team `446BLT75JZ`.
- An App Store Connect API key with the role required to manage signing assets
  and upload builds. Keep its key ID, issuer ID, and `.p8` private key secret.
- A unique numeric `CFBundleVersion` for every uploaded build.
- App Privacy answers completed once in App Store Connect; Apple does not
  expose the complete questionnaire through the public API.

The repository sets `EXPO_USE_PRECOMPILED_MODULES=false` for release builds.
This preserves the known-good behavior from the original remote-Mac release:
native modules compile from the exact checkout instead of relying on a
potentially incompatible precompiled React Native framework.

## Protected GitHub Actions path

Use `.github/workflows/ios-build.yml`.

1. The workflow is manual and runs on `macos-15`.
2. It generates `ios/` with Expo CNG, installs pods, and resolves the generated
   workspace and shared scheme.
3. The reviewed `macos-signing` environment supplies the App Store Connect API
   key. Its deployment policy is main-only; never broaden it to arbitrary PR
   branches.
4. The protected job creates an ephemeral Apple Distribution private key/CSR,
   certificate, and `IOS_APP_STORE` profile through the App Store Connect API.
   It imports the identity into a temporary keychain, then archives with manual
   distribution signing and `github.run_number` as `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.
   An `always()` cleanup revokes the temporary profile/certificate and removes
   local key material.
5. Before export, CI verifies the archive authority and embedded profile:
   no registered-device list, `get-task-allow=false`, and the expected
   team-qualified application identifier.
6. Export creates an App Store IPA and uploads it as an artifact before the
   optional TestFlight step.

First run with `upload_testflight=false`. Inspect and retain the IPA artifact.
Only after that gate succeeds should a maintainer run the same workflow with
`upload_testflight=true`.

## Remote or self-hosted Mac path

An SSH/background session may not have usable access to `login.keychain-db`.
The characteristic signing failure is `errSecInternalComponent`. For that
environment, create a dedicated temporary build keychain, import an Apple
Distribution identity and private key, and grant `codesign` access:

```sh
security create-keychain -p '<KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD>' build.keychain-db
security unlock-keychain -p '<KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD>' build.keychain-db
security import '<DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE.p12>' \
  -k build.keychain-db -P '<P12_PASSWORD>' -A -T /usr/bin/codesign
security set-key-partition-list \
  -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign: -s \
  -k '<KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD>' build.keychain-db
security list-keychains -d user -s build.keychain-db login.keychain-db
```

Unlock, partition-list configuration, archive, and export must remain in the
same session. Delete the temporary keychain and decrypted credentials after
the build. Do not copy this keychain workaround into GitHub-hosted Actions;
that workflow uses its reviewed environment and ephemeral runner keychain.

## Archive and export contract

The effective command shape is:

```sh
EXPO_USE_PRECOMPILED_MODULES=false npx expo prebuild --platform ios --no-install
(cd ios && pod install)

xcodebuild \
  -workspace ios/<App>.xcworkspace \
  -scheme <Scheme> \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -archivePath build/App.xcarchive \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=446BLT75JZ \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual \
  'CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=Apple Distribution' \
  PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER='<EPHEMERAL_IOS_APP_STORE_PROFILE>' \
  CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION=<UNIQUE_NUMERIC_BUILD> \
  clean archive

xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath build/App.xcarchive \
  -exportPath build/ipa \
  -exportOptionsPlist ios-ci/ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

The actual workflow additionally supplies App Store Connect API-key arguments
to both commands. Never print those secret values.

## TestFlight and App Store Connect API

After upload, use an ES256 JWT (`kid`, issuer, `aud=appstoreconnect-v1`) with
the App Store Connect REST API to:

1. set export-compliance metadata and attach the build to an internal beta
   group;
2. attach a tested build to the App Store version;
3. maintain localizations, category, age rating, privacy-policy URL, screenshots,
   and pricing;
4. create a review submission and submit it only after every required item is
   complete.

Do not automate the final TestFlight upload or App Store review submission
until the preceding artifact/runtime gates have succeeded for that exact build.

## Failure signals

- Requests registered devices / `iOS App Development`: archive selected the
  wrong identity/profile; the distribution verification step must fail.
- `errSecInternalComponent` on an SSH Mac: private-key/keychain access problem,
  not a provisioning-profile request.
- Duplicate build number: rerun through Actions so a new `github.run_number`
  becomes `CFBundleVersion`.
- IPA succeeds but app crashes at launch: confirm the release used
  `EXPO_USE_PRECOMPILED_MODULES=false` and test the exact artifact before any
  submission.
